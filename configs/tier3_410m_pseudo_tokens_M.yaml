# Run M: Pseudo-token decoder — attention-compatible delivery from compressed summaries
# Hardware: 1x A100 80GB (RunPod)
#
# After 25 configurations, the diagnosed failure mode is consistent:
#   One vector can't serve all queries simultaneously.
#   Oracle analysis: even cosine 0.96 summary recovered only 1.1/17.7 PPL gap.
#   Logit bias: one vocab-sized vector shifts all positions identically.
#   Adapter/LoRA: model self-adapts around summaries, ignoring them.
#
# This run tests the one approach that directly addresses the bottleneck:
#   Decode the 128-dim summary into 8 pseudo-token embeddings at d_model.
#   Prepend them so different attention heads can selectively attend to
#   different pseudo-tokens. Each can specialize: entity, topic, discourse,
#   syntactic expectations, etc.
#
# Key difference from K=4 (Run with n_summary_tokens=4):
#   K=4 was 4 independent pooling operations from commitment head.
#   This is a LEARNED EXPANSION: commitment head compresses → 128-dim,
#   separate decoder reconstructs diverse, attention-compatible representations.
#   Bottleneck forces prioritization; expansion restores diversity.
#
# Compare against Run F's +0.5 flat baseline.
# If pseudo-token delivery beats +0.5, we've found the channel.
# If it matches or underperforms, the bottleneck is encoding, not delivery.
